# Boat Race in Java

This was a university project I completed in my first year, circa August 2023. 

Boat Race is essentially a Snakes and Ladders game. 

However, the snakes are traps, the ladders are currents, and the pieces are boats. 

The game is only printed to the terminal. 

I brought this over from a private repository under my university onto this public repository I created for myself. 

I decided to do this after an interview I had for my internship.
